# Description:
# Ini file for parselog.pl and parsseq.pl
# Section description:
# ExcludeClass		Names of C++ node classes to exclude
# ExcludeMessage	Names of messages to exclude
# ExcludeIpc		Names of client/server IPCs to exclude
# ExcludeShortName	Names of nodes to exclude via their "short" name (i.e. the name that they appear as on the SVG display)
# ExcludeSingleTuple	Names of single tuple activities to be excluded (these are generally very simple activities,
# such as PRControlClientJoin or PRForwardStateChange, where printing out the single tuple does
# not add any more information than seeing the corresponding message being received at the node, and
# just clutter up the display).  The special name "*" in the section means exclude all single tuples.
# MessageArguments	List of arguments to display per message.  Format of the section is:
# <message> <argument> [<argument>*]
# <argument> := <data member name>[:node]
# By default, arguments are displayed as signed decimal.  The addition of the postfix ":node"
# against an argument indicates that the argument is the address of a node and should be
# displayed as the node name.
# ObjectNameTruncateAndOrder
# Used to shorten object names and indicate left-to-right object placement order on the display.
# Format of section is:
# <string> <substitute string> <placement order>
# Any occurrence of <string> in an object name is replaced with <substitute string>.  For each object
# name, all entries in the section are scanned from first to last and any matching string substitutions
# are applied in turn.  In addition, the first non-zero value of <placement order> from the list of matching
# entries	is taken to be the object order.  <placement order> is a number, starting from one, indicating the
# left-to-right ordering position on the display, relative to other objects whose <placement order> has been
# specified (for example,	objects with order 2 will be to the left of those with order 3).  A value of zero
# means no placement ordering is specified.  This is used to just apply a string substitution.

[ExcludeClass]

# Excluding Tier manager and Container classes makes the relationship diagram much clearer.
# Excluding the SelectionRequest and FlowRequest classes also makes it clearer - include them
# (by commenting them out) as required.
