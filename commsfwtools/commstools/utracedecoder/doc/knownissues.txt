Known Issues
========================

1) [RESOLVED] The formatting of the thread context id doesn't always output consistently when the context is NULL.
Misses the 0x off but still pads to a width of 10 using '0'.

2) The include file handling hasn't been tested much and probably isn't very robust. Use relative
includes with caution. If the message definition files are in the same directory it should work fine.

3) [RESOLVED-v1.10] When the TMessageId structure is output the enum name resolution doesn't always work because the struct
only knows about the NM_Message_Ids enumeration defined in the same header file. Any other messages
(for example esock ones) don't get the name. Fixed up so that at least the value is output now.
May need to either:
	i) Make TMessageId a built-in type so that it can use the RealmId and a new command to map
	realms to enum lists.
	or
	ii) Add support for some kind of dynamic enum type, that would use another member to look
	up the enum. This would still need a way of mapping id x to an enum. More flexible, but
	more complicated to implement than (i).
	
4) [RESOLVED-v1.12] INTs are treated as UINTs.

5) It is possible for contexts/signatures to have multiple members with the same name.
Currently there is no check against base types for duplicate member names.

6) [RESOLVED-2008-03-11] TSigSelectComplete decodes/outputs incorrectly (definition file error)	

7) [RESOLVED-v1.14] It is possible for frames to have a size < 12

8) [RESOLVED-v1.15] Fixed problem in data offset calculation resulting in data access violation for certain log frames
	
Future Improvements
========================

1) [RESOLVED-v1.14] Add support for aliases - allows for names to be used as they are in the code, but without having to
duplicate the structures in the definition file.

ALIAS SIGNATURE TSomeMessageSig = TSomeExistingMessageSig
ALIAS CONTEXT TSomeContext = TSomeExistingContext
ALIAS STRUCT TSomeStruct = TSomeExistingStruct

2) Add support for arrays
STRUCT TSomeStruct
	UINT8 iByteArray[30]
	UINT32 iAnotherArray[2]
END STRUCT

3) [PARTIAL - ADDITIONAL MODIFIER LIKE HEX,DECIMAL] Add support for binary dumps (using the DumpBytes() method)
STRUCT TSomeStruct
	BINARY iSocketAddrData[0x20];
END STRUCT

4) Add support for strings
STRUCT TSomeStruct
	STRING iUsername[32]
	WSTRING iUnicodeUsername[32] // maybe not
END STRUCT

5) Add support for the other event types listed in e32btrace.h

6) [RESOLVED-v1.12] Add support for multi line comments

7) [RESOLVED-v1.12] Add support for hinting the output format - hex or dec

8) Allow structs to have base types

9) Add HIDDEN modifier to all member types

10) [RESOLVED-v1.15] Add --quiet option to avoid warning output of unknown/unsupported frame types
