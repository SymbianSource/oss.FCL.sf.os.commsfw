    <description>Added an extra section to the CommsDebugUtility How To documentation FAQ listing the components which must be properly matched for logging to work on a target.  Added extra RDebug output so that if a crash results from mismatched components then more information will be printed for the programmer to understand what has happened.</description>

  <purpose>
    Provides the main thread in the C32 process. The Root Server thread is responsible for starting and managing all the other C32 threads. It starts these at device boot, rather than on demand as in previous OS releases. Rootserver uses Commsfw and Mbufman to communicate and monitor the other servers.
