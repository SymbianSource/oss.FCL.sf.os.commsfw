# mbuf manager memory constraints - no bearing on the pools; the key name has been kept for backward compatibility

# mbuf size allocation information
# - mbuf size guidelines;
#   a. 128 byte is mandatory for some (poorly writen) legacy code that assumes the existance of mbufs of this size
#   b. < 128 byte is acceptable, but could break some (poorly written) legacy code that assumes that minimum mbuf size is 128
# - format = mbuf size(in bytes), initial allocation (in mbufs), minimum growth (in mbufs), automatic growth threshold (in mbufs)
