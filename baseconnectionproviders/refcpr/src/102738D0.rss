 * Description:
 * [1] dll_uid should be the same as the name of this file. It stands for the UID of 
 *     this ECOM plugin. In order to obtain a new UID, register at the 
 *     "EPOC UID Allocation Database". Each plugin needs a array of UIDs:
 *     - one for the dll
 *     - one for the Connection Factory implementation id.
 *     The UIDs listed in this file are either interface UIDs or implementation
 *     UIDs registered for this particular plug-in. The latter should be replaced
 *     for each new plug-in. 
 * [2] interface_uid is the ECOM plugin intergface id. In this file:
 *     0x102738D1 - Connection Provider Factory interface id.
