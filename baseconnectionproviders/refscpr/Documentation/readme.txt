SubConnProv\ReferenceSCPR

This component is an example/reference implementation of:
- a subconnection provider (as defined by CSubConnectionProviderBase)
- a subconnection parameter extension set.

Developers are encouraged to use this reference whatever way they
like (e.g.: fill it up with content).

This component does not hold any functionality and should not be 
built during system build.
